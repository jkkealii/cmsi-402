# _3.0_ Project Proposal

## Verbal Description

_"The Tube"_ aims to be a web platform one layer above YouTube, in that it provides users with easily-accessible ordered collections of videos, called "serials," centered around a certain topic or subject. Users will be able to log in with Facebook, Twitter, or Google, search/browse both site-curated and user-curated serials, make their own serials based on pre-existing or new topics, upvote or downvote serials or individual videos (which will make site-curated serials dynamic in nature), comment on serials, and verify their accounts based on expertise or being a YouTube content creator. As far as I know, there is currently no similar web platforms that offer these features, but I was inspired by _8tracks_, _Khan Academy_, various educational YouTube channels, and the difficulty of finding quality videos on YouTube.

This project will require database (either MongoDB or PostgreSQL), backend, and frontend development. I will be working extensively with the YouTube API, and I will be designing the website with a mobile-first approach. The end user of this application would be any internet user who likes to watch YouTube videos, but is frustrated with having to endlessly browse for quality content. YouTube is increasingly becoming a space for users to literally watch and learn about topics ranging from marine biology to makeup tips, but it is often difficult for content creators to get noticed with YouTube's algorithms for deciding recommendations. Because the website will pride itself on real human curation, maintenance would require at least a small team to constantly be searching for new content and moderating existing site-curated serials.

## Justification

This project is a good fit for the purposes of this class, because it will require me to draw upon what I have learned in classes such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Interaction Design, Computer Graphics, and 401. Not only will I be relying upon what I have learned in these classes, but I will be going beyond what I have done in them. For example, in 401, we made a web application that also had database, backend, and frontend development involved, but I was mainly involved in the frontend development, so I will now be responsible for the entirety of the stack. Developing a full web platform from the top to bottom is not easy, but if needed, there are always many stretch features that I can add as we near the end the semester. I believe I have the skills and tools needed to complete this project, and I am passionate about creating something that has the potential to change the way people learn and watch videos.
