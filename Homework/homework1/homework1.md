* 1.1
  All software engineering projects must be able to handle requirements gathering, high-level design, low-level design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and wrap-up. There are different development models that approach these tasks differently, but all are essential for effective project management.

* 1.2
  1. requirements gathering: probe the customer(s) for their wants and needs and compile them into a requirments document.
  2. high-level design: plan of the project architecture at a high level, also include things like platform, data design, and interfaces with other systems.
  3. low-level design: information regarding _how_ each piece of the project should work, something the programmers can use for guidance.
  4. development: the best part; programmers implement the low-level design by coding.
  5. testing: should be done constantly by both programmers and testers who didn't write the code, aim to minimize bug occurence.
  6. deployment: release software into the world; may be a long and expensive process.
  7. maintenance: after the release, users will find bugs, and you must fix them.
  8. wrap-up: evaluate the project as a whole and review what went wrong and what went well.

* 2.4
  Successfully created a new Google Doc, saved it, closed it, reopened it and made changes. Reviewed the changes as well.

* 2.5
  JBGE stands for "just barely good enough," and it is usually referring to how programmers should think about code commenting for future developers. In order to save time when coding, comments and code documentation should be written, but just barely good enough to possibly aid the next person who looks at your code.

* 3.2
  The critical path has tasks: G, D, E, M, and Q. The total expected duration of the project is 32 working days.

* 3.6
  A project manager could create "sick time tasks" at the end of the schedule and insert its lost time into the schedule when an unexpected problem comes up.

* 3.8
  One mistake you can make while tracking tasks is ignoring a task that doesn't follow the schedule. If a task is taking too long, or seems like it is not on schedule, the project manager needs to follow up. Another mistake is adding more people to the problem in order to try and finish a task more quickly. That usually just ends up taking more time since they need to be brought up to speed on what is happening.

* 4.1
  Good requirements are clear, unambiguous, consistent, prioritized, and verifiable.

  It looks like every requirement has at least one category, but there are no implementation requirements. New hardware may be required, but you probably already have everything you need for the program to be implemented, so there are no implementation requirements necessary.

* 4.9
  * Different colors (C) - The program could allow users to change the color scheme of the game, for personalization or accessibility reasons.
  * Different hangmen (C) - The program could let the user pick from a set of different hangmen, other than the skeleton.
  * Time limit (W) - The program could have a time limit mode, where users must choose each letter within a certain amount of time, or the game as a whole could last a certain amount of time.
  * Advertising (M) - To generate revenue, the program could display ads either between games or at the bottom of the screen.
  * Score (S) - The program could generate scores based on the difficulty of the word and/or the speed of the player.
